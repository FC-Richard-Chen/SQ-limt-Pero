# SQ-limt-Pero
Calculation of the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) Limits for two indoor light sources

This notebook follows two important scripts.
The original Mathematica script was posted by Steve Byrnes; the pdf file can be downloaded in the following link:

The other script is the code written in python, which can be found here:

This script further applies the model to artificial light sources. 

The result of the calculation of SQ limits has been publsihed in Advanced Energy Materials (2019)
