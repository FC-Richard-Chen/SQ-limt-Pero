# SQ-limt-Pero
Calculation of the Shockley-Queisser Limits for two indoor light sources

The notebook follows two important scripts.
The original Mathematica script was posted by Steve Byrnes; the pdf file can be downloaded in the following link:

The other is the revised code in python, which can be found here:

It further applies the model to artificial light sources.
